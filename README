MLOG(1)                     General Commands Manual                    MLOG(1)

NAME
     mlog – merge log files by timestamp

SYNOPSIS
     mlog [-f] [-s] [-u] [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
     mlog reads lines from multiple log files and prints them in chronological
     order.  The files need to start with comparable timestamps.  mlog prints
     the oldest line first, thus preserving relative order.

     mlog behaves like a combination of ‘sort -m’ and ‘tail -f’.

     The options are as follows:

     -f      Follow the output files, output appended lines as file grows.
             When the file is truncated or recreated, start from beginning.
             With two -f flags, seek to the end of files on start and only
             print fresh lines.

     -s      Strip a prefix generated by socklog(8) from each line, which have
             a format like ‘facility.priority: timestamp’.

     -u      Only print unique lines.  If other files contain the same line at
             the current position, skip them.

EXIT STATUS
     The mlog utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

INTERNALS
     On Linux, inotify(7) is used to detect file changes.
